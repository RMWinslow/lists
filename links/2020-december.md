## Browser links to read later

There are a number of pages I've had open in my browser for a long long time. I'm putting them here so I can close those tabs, find them later, and save energy and computer memory.


[Brian Wheaton's Research page](https://scholar.harvard.edu/wheaton/publications)
: He's a phd candidate but already has lots of papers in the works. Rahman pointed him out as an example to follow.

[Understanding productivity gap](https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-6/understanding-the-labor-productivity-and-compensation-gap.htm)
: Article from Fed showing how productivity and compensation have grown differently in different industries.

[Online Spacial and Urban Seminar](http://www.urbaneconomics.org/seminars/season02/)
: List of talks and papers relevant to urban economics.

[Article on Career advice](https://leveragethoughts.substack.com/p/early-career-tactics-to-accelerate)
: Business focused. Only actionable advice seems to be "Seek Counsel From a Trusted Mentor"

[Windows 7 support ended.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-7-end-of-life-support-information?OCID=win7_app_omc_win)
: Microsoft wants me to upgrade.

[Adam Kucharski](https://kucharski.io/academic/)
: Covid reseearch and also I like his website format.

[Grad school advice](http://matt.might.net/articles/successful-phd-students/)
: Article about the importance of Perseverance, Tenacity, and Cogency And here's [a similar article](http://matt.might.net/articles/advice-for-phd-thesis-proposals/) about preparing a thesis proposal.

[Reddit thread about phd job prospects](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x6sh2/phd_students_of_reddit_do_you_regret_it/)
: Pessemistic title aside, comments have some advice I need to put into action. Maybe I should talk to dad about this over break.

    >  i've seen lots of my colleagues just go through grad school oblivious to preparing themselves to go on the job market and not having a backup plan if they can't catch on as faculty somewhere. these are the people who should not have started in the first place. i have other colleagues who were very strategic in all of the decisions that they made in grad school - who their committee members were, their topics of research, the types of grants that they spent the most time trying to get, etc etc...these people got a job no problem. they weren't necessarily smarter from a subject point of view, but they were smarter about how to go through grad school.

    > when i went abd, i decided to get a full time job (which i dont recommend necessarily - writing a diss and working full time really really sucks). but in any case, my statistical training made finding a job pretty easy and believe it or not, the job market for people who can do statistics is not that bad. and now that's what i'm doing, crunching numbers for a university. I'm also teaching at the local city college - not because i need the extra money, but because i actually like teaching my subject and this way i don't have to go through the hoops of getting tenure (the obvious caveat being, if you're not a full time faculty member, teaching city college classes doesn't pay very well).

    > Regarding your GF. UT is well regarded in this soc, and her professors, if she does the social networking part correctly, can be a huge help in finding her a job. the key is finding the right professor who will take care of their students. i'd estimate that this is about 15-20 percent of most faculties at R-1 schools, so she needs to choose committee carefully.

[The results of the MEDBI competition](https://mebdi.org/2020-mebdi-ml-competition/)
: Want to read about the techniques. I feel like my comparative advantage coming in was computer and math skills and I've now lost that advantage.

[Oral Scheduling](https://onestop.umn.edu/academics/doctoral-oral-exam-scheduling)
: Officially need to get this done by the end of next semester.

[Chrome password alert](chrome://settings/passwords/check?start=true)
: Have a bunch of crappy passwords on secondy accounts. Should probs fix that when I ge tthe time.


## Covid related links

[Health and Pandemics Panel](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/econhelp-workinggroup/home?authuser=0)
: Lots of interesting links to papers

[Network externalities](https://thebusinessprofessor.com/lesson/network-externalities-defined/)
: Links to several papers about the concept. Mostly related to entrepenuership actually. Not disease.

[NBER Health Economics](https://www.nber.org/programs-projects/programs-working-groups/health-economics?page=1&perPage=50)
: NBER working group on health economics. I planned to skim through these week's ago but I'm a failure that can't commit to things or properly plan.

[A Theory of Voluntary Testing and Self-isolation in an Ongoing Pandemic](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27941)
: Paper to read later

[Index of Dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_dispersion)
: It's just $$\frac{sigma^2}{\mu}$$. Don't know why I had this pinned. Notable that binomial has this parameter less than 1, poisson has it exactly 1, and negative binomial greater than 1.

[Poisson distribution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/poisson-distribution)
: A topics page for poisson distribution?

[Poisson Gamma and Negative Binomial](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2019/09/16/poisson-gamma-nb/)
: REelvant article and also really nice minimal website layout. Look at the blog. Fast churn out of polished little math snippets. Ah, excellent, he provides [the files](https://github.com/gwgundersen/blog-theme) for the github pages style. The description mentions a plugin that sounds handy called [Jekyll Scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar). Finally, [here's a really interesting looking blogpost](http://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/01/12/why-research-blog/) with some motivational philosophy about research and blogging. TODO: fork his blog. TODO: Make a little script page that keeps citations in bibtex format in a string and then has a little javascript doodad to parse them and render as html blurps.


Also various papers in my google docs folder.
