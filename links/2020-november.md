[Juanelo Turriano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juanelo_Turriano) was the Court Clock Master for Emporer Charles V. 
He built such marvels as:
The Cristalano, an astronomical clock;
[The Artificio de Juanelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificio_de_Juanelo), an automated system to lift water 100 meters to a castle;
and the [Clockwork Prayer](https://blackbird.vcu.edu/v1n1/nonfiction/king_e/prayer_introduction.htm), an automaton built to worship the Lord.

> In the Smithsonian Institution is a sixteenth-century automaton of a monk, made of wood and iron, 15 inches in height. Driven by a key-wound spring, the monk walks in a square, striking his chest with his right arm, raising and lowering a small wooden cross and rosary in his left hand, turning and nodding his head, rolling his eyes, and mouthing silent obsequies. From time to time, he brings the cross to his lips and kisses it.
> ... The story is told that the emperor's son King Philip II, praying at the bedside of a dying son of his own, promised a miracle for a miracle, if his child be spared. And when the child did indeed recover, Philip kept his bargain by having [the Court Clock Master] Turriano construct a miniature penitent homunculus.
