: A catchy diddy about the laws of thermodynamics. (The song starts at about 2 minutes in.)


The NIST's sneaky rng backdoor
: [Back in 2007](https://archive.is/20120919094854/http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/11/securitymatters_1115), the NIST issued some new statements about pseudo-random number generators. But of the four methods, they described, one of them looked pretty suspicious. Then in 2013, the Snowden leaks [confirmed](https://web.archive.org/web/20130910030443/http://fcw.com/Articles/2013/09/06/NSA-NIST-standards.aspx) that sure enough, the NSA managed to get some backdoors into the standards, compromising internet security. Afterwards, the NIST removed the compromised algorithm, and [recommended](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829031025/http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/sp800-90-042114.cfm) that everyone stop using it.
