title: Interesting links from 2021 Spring
description: This is a collection of interesting links I have come across during the early parts of 2021. The links are things I think might be worth sharing with other people. Some are interesting. Some are useful. Some are just strange.

[Flanders & Swann - 'First And Second Law'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnbiVw_1FNs)
: A catchy diddy about the laws of thermodynamics. (The song starts at about 2 minutes in.)


The NIST's sneaky rng backdoor
: [Back in 2007](https://archive.is/20120919094854/http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/11/securitymatters_1115), the NIST issued some new statements about pseudo-random number generators. But of the four methods, they described, one of them looked pretty suspicious. Then in 2013, the Snowden leaks [confirmed](https://web.archive.org/web/20130910030443/http://fcw.com/Articles/2013/09/06/NSA-NIST-standards.aspx) that sure enough, the NSA managed to get some backdoors into the standards, compromising internet security. Afterwards, the NIST removed the compromised algorithm, and [recommended](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829031025/http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/sp800-90-042114.cfm) that everyone stop using it.


[Image Display Technology](http://www.marcelpatek.com/LCD.html)
: An article with lots of pictures comparing the physics of CRT vs LCD monitors.


[Multi-Modal Nuerons in AI](https://openai.com/blog/multimodal-neurons/)
: New AI can associate pictures of a thing with drawings and dscriptions of the thing. Impressive. But a side effect of this is that you can write iPod on an apple and the AI will think it's an iPod.


[Petit Tube](https://petittube.com/)
: Random Youtube videos with almost no views.

[Phylotree.js](http://phylotree.hyphy.org/)
: Can paste in a Newick style tree, and it will display it as a pretty phylogenetic tree.


[Global Burden of Disease Data](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2017/code)
: Some cool visualizations of various international health stuff. For example, [this comparison](https://gbd2017.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/) of global DALY loss. Note that it's not number of deaths; it's years of lost life expectancy or quality of life. More graphs and stuff [here.](http://www.healthdata.org/gbd/data-visualizations)


[Wrestling: The Oldest Sport](https://nwhof.org/stillwater/resources-library/history/the-oldest-sport/)
: Did you know that wrestling is an ancient and near universal cultural practice? George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Plato: all professional wrestlers. Also, there's a random broken english sentence linking to a defunct shady chinese pharmaceuticals website in the middle of an otherwise well-written article. Did the National Wrestling Hall of Fame get hacked or something?


[National Libary of Scotland - Maps](https://maps.nls.uk/index.html)
: A website with scans of historical maps and the ability to overlay them on top of a standard zoomable web map. In particular, check out this stylish [set of world maps from 1920](https://maps.nls.uk/atlas/times-survey/index.html) and in particular [this compilation](https://maps.nls.uk/view/101105572) of historical world maps; or this hand drawn [military survey of scotland](https://maps.nls.uk/geo/roy/#zoom=7.232851306515763&lat=57.3230&lon=-4.7536&layers=roy-highlands).


Pam Jiles
: Proud otaku politician from Chile. [Did a Naruto run in congress.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN8e77oJUyM) [.](https://twitter.com/PamJiles) [.](https://twitter.com/PopulismUpdates/status/1374135225920331777)


[Chernozem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernozem)
: Ukraine is one of the places where Chernozem can be found. It's really high quality black soil. It wasn't until recently in 2020 that [Ukraine repealed the ban on the sale of farmlands](https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/31/ukraine-lifts-ban-on-sale-of-farmland-in-bid-to-receive-international-funds
). But even before that, according to [this op-ed](https://www.kyivpost.com/article/opinion/op-ed/black-market-for-rich-black-earth-116610.html), there was a thriving black market for the soil itself.


[Suez Canal got blocked](https://twitter.com/jsrailton/status/1374438210315513864)
: Woopsy. The boat driver done got the thing stuck in there sideways. Vessel is the [Ever Given](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/EVER-GIVEN-IMO-9811000-MMSI-353136000). Apparently not the first time this boat has had [troubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ever_Given).



Assorted fantasy map generators
: [This one has interactive example widgets,](http://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/) and [here's a twitter bot](https://twitter.com/unchartedatlas) that tweets examples every hour. The names are [generated algorithmically](http://mewo2.com/notes/naming-language/) as well. [Collection](https://olinkirk.land/realms/resources.html) of map-related links. [City generator](https://watabou.itch.io/medieval-fantasy-city-generator). [Azgaar's map generator](https://azgaar.github.io/Fantasy-Map-Generator/).












[Lego User Interfaces](https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/2020/LEGO-Interface-UX/)
: Compares and ranks the fake computer interfaces printed on Lego blocks. Lots of interesting tidbits about interface design in general. When the B-52 was originally designed, the knobs all looked the same, which led to pilots retracting the wheels during landing.
