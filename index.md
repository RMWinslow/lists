<article markdown="block">
  
 This is a test of how articles are rendered inside my css inside github pages
 
 Will the default markdown behavior also be preserved?
 
 Okay, the **markdown** wasn't being rendered, but what if I know add the `markdown="block"` to the tag?
 like in the JTD documentation?
