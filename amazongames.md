## Full list In reverse chrono order

- Jim Henson's The Dark Crystal Age of Resistance Tactics
- Escape Machine City Airborne
- Optica
- Tengami
    - Bad. Nothing
    - I think it's trying to a puzle game. But the gameplay loop is click on a glowing dot, wait a full minute for your little guy to slowly walk over to it, then click on the new glowing dot that appears.
- Blasphemous
- SkyDrift
- Boomerang Fu
- Sine Mora Ex
- The Academy (The First Riddle)
    - Bad. Puzzles.
    - It's a professor Layton style puzzle game, but the instructions and solutions are poorly translated, which ruins it. The *very first* puzzle has a errors in the solution translation. 
- Adventures of Chris
    - Okay. 2D Platformer.
    - Some cute bits, some fun characters. But also some really janky platforming sections.
- Spinch
    - Meh. 2D Platformer.
    - Cute style but nothing special.

    - Good. 2D Platformer.
    - Great style, fun mechanics, but man, the character dialogue is just too long winded and on the nose.
- The Occupation
- Aurion: Legacy of the Kori-Odan
- Victor VRan

    - Okay. 3D Platformer.
    - The overworld surfing mechanic is really fun, but the dungeons and combat are plodding.

- Impulsion
- Tempest
- Shock Troopers
- Ironclad
- King of the Monsters
- Sengoku 3
- SNK 40th Anniversary
- Shaw Fu: A Legend Reborn
- The Inner World
    - Bad. Point and Click
    - I like the concept of the world (weird worm people living inside a dirt ball) but the game is glitchy, poorly ported from mobile, and wastes just so much time.

    - Bad. 2D Platformer
    - Simple little game about a small child in a dangerous world. Occasionally it makes you walk through longer corridors while a voiceover waxes philosophically about color. And it irrationally annoyed me because all the stuff it says about colors is BS. No purple is not the farthest color, nor the most difficult for our eyes to distinguish. No, it's not a cultural universal that every culture calls the sky blue. And why on earth does this simple 2D platformer make my graphics card scream out in pain?! Are the background particle effects really that unoptimized?
