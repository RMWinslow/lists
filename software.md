Youtube's recomendation algorithm is evil and an unsorted list of every subscription isn't great for finding stuff I want to watch, so I made a categorized list of youtube channels that I like to check occasionally.


## Android Apps:

### note-taking

- GitJournal. Pros: One of the few android apps that lets me edit a github repo. Cons: Poor typing interface; no math preview.
- Markor. 
- Nuetrinote.


## Crappy Software.

- Workflowy. It's just a plaintext nested bullet point list. But they want you to pay 50 dollars to be able to add more than 250 items to the list. At least you have to admire their confidence.
