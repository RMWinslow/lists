## Health and medicine

[Examine.com](https://examine.com/)
: Summaries of evidence behind various nutritional supplements. Only has info about the ingredients; not about specific products. Basically the only website on nutrition I've found that actually cares about evidence. [eg](https://examine.com/supplements/magnesium/)


[Labdoor](https://labdoor.com/)
: Provides rankings and ingredient info on supplements. [eg](https://labdoor.com/rankings/magnesium)
