## Arithmetic

[Desmos Calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator)
: Real time equation rendering. Better than typing the equation into wolfram like I've been doing for visualizations.





## The Skies

[Light Pollution Map](https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/#zoom=4.00&lat=40.3141&lon=-94.5941&layers=B0FFFFFTFFFFFFFFFF)
: Shows an estimate of how far the light pollution from cities spreads. Useful for finding stargazing locations.

[Aurora Borealis Forecast](https://cdn.softservenews.com/Aurora.htm)
: Short terms updates about incoming space storms. It's very rare that the Northern Lights reach down to the lower 48, but just in case, this link might come in handy.




## Health and medicine

[Examine.com](https://examine.com/)
: Summaries of evidence behind various nutritional supplements. Only has info about the ingredients; not about specific products. Basically the only website on nutrition I've found that actually cares about evidence. [eg](https://examine.com/supplements/magnesium/)


[Labdoor](https://labdoor.com/)
: Provides rankings and ingredient info on supplements. [eg](https://labdoor.com/rankings/magnesium)


## Colors

[Colormind](http://colormind.io/bootstrap/)
: Website color pallette generator

[Color Brewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/)
: Color advice for cartography. Gives you a set of easy to read perceptually uniform color schemes for maps.

[Coolors](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending)
: Another color palette generator. Just for prettiness; not for website. See also [poolors](https://poolors.com/), the ugly color scheme generator.
