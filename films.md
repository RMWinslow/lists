Tenet (2020, watched 2020 Dec) ðŸ‘Ž
: The [Sator Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sator_Square) is an ancient meme from Pompeii
in which the words SATOR OPERA TENET AREPO ROTAS are arranged into a square to form a 4-way palindrome.
Unfortunately, the word "Arepo" is meaningless. Whoever came up with the meme thought the *concept* was neat, 
but didn't actually have a solid idea of what to put into it.
